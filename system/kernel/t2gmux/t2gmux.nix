# t2gmux, the gmux driver of KaiT2en (helpws plan-dgpu): powers the AMD dGPU
# of MacBookPro16,1 off and on the way macOS does (ACPI PWRD), replacing
# apple-gmux. `ws-gmux build` fetches modules/t2gmux at this commit and builds
# it for a kernel in podman.
#
# Newer commit: change it here, `ws switch`, `ws-gmux build`, `ws-gmux
# install`, test (helpws plan-dgpu).
#
# Built into ~/.local/share/workstation/t2gmux/source (REPO COMMIT), read by
# ws-gmux.
