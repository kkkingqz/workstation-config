# Patched t2bce modules (helpws suspend): for every kernel release the
# linux-t2-patches commit whose 1001-Add-t2bce-driver-stack.patch produced
# its in-tree t2bce. `ws-suspend t2bce-build` fetches that patch, applies
# nostate-fix.patch and builds the modules for the kernel.
#
# New kernel: add its release and commit here, `ws switch`, then
# `ws-suspend t2bce-build KERNEL` (helpws suspend).
#
# Built into ~/.local/share/workstation/t2bce/sources (KERNEL COMMIT per
# line), read by ws-suspend and ws-workstation-verify.
